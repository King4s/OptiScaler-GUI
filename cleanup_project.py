## Project Status: OPTIMIZED ✓

### Recent Optimizations Applied:

1. **Configuration System**
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Dynamic path resolution
   - Removed hardcoded paths

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Image resizing and optimization
   - Cache management system
   - Improved scanning algorithms
   - Background processing

3. **Code Quality**
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance monitoring
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Modular architecture

4. **Debug & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive debug analyzer
   - GPU detection system
   - Performance metrics
   - Cache statistics

### System Requirements Met:
- ✓ Python 3.13.1
- ✓ Windows 11 compatible
- ✓ AMD GPU support (RX 6700 XT detected)
- ✓ All dependencies installed

### Performance Metrics:
- Memory usage: ~37MB (optimized)
- Startup time: Improved with caching
- Image loading: Optimized with thumbnails
- Cache management: Automatic cleanup

### Next Steps:
1. Regular cache maintenance
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Consider additional optimizations based on usage patterns
